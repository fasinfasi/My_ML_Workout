I Learned more as much as I could, Not only learned things I did lots of exercises by myself.
This can tell about my passion in machine learning. And the ability to do more things with patiently.

I have struggled a lot with my old version system but it couldn't beat me because my desire kept me with it. I don't want to be fail.

My journey is quiet hard to be learn, My entire progess was slow. But i knew, 

[ " Slow progress 🐌 is better than No progess 🦥 " ]

---- Spent MORE time achieve MORE ----
